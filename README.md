# Personality_detection
Personality detection project using SVM and LSTM in the context of a Master's Degree program. 

In this project we worked on  the automatic classification of the big five personality traits by comparing an SVM model and an LSTM model.
Our results showed that LSTM can achive higher performance in this task than our supervised SVM model.
